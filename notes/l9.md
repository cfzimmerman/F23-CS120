**Recap Random Algorithms**

- Las Vegas algorithms are always correct but may never complete or may have a super long tail to complete

**Dictionary data structure**

- Updates: insert or delete a key-value pair with k in the universe of U
- Queries: Given a key K, returna matching key-value pair (k, V) from the structure if one exists
  - Return bot if a key is requested that is not currently inserted

**Data structure for dictionary**

- Requires:
  - Preprocess(u)
  - Insert(k, v)
  - Delete(k, v)
  - Search(k)
- Can use an linked list or BST for deterministic
- Can use a random data structure too

**Random solution**

- Using random locations for each value yields some probability of collision and thus failure, but that's allowed by a Monte Carlo algorithm
- (number of keys / size of array) is the load, alpha, of the data structure

**Hash solution (Monte Carlo)**

- A random hash function is similar to a random function except evaluating, generating, and storing `h(x)` takes time `O(1)`
  - Assumes `h(x)` fits within the word size
- Choosing a random hash function makes preprocess, insert, delete, and search take O(1) time with still `n/m` probability of failure

**Hash solution (Las Vegas)**

- Same operations as before:
  - Insert, still add to head of list
  - Delete, now need to search through list to delete correct key
  - Search also needs to search the list for the proper key
- Now, it's always correct, but traversing the list does not guarantee constant time
  - Time is now Θ(1 + sizeof(linked list at h(k)))
  - Expected time is Θ(1 + E(sizeof(linked list at h(k)))) equal to Θ(1 + (n / m))

**Recap: insert, delete, search**

- Sort the data set, store in an array
- Store the data in a binary search tree
- Run randomized quick select on the data
- Store the data in a hash table
