**Computational problem**

- A computational problem is often denoted by capital Pi
- Pi is a set of inputs (I), a set of outputs (O), and a set of solutions (f).
- For all x in inputs, f(x) is a subset of outputs
- f(x) is a subset of O because there may be two valid outputs for a given inputs
  - ex: input = [(1, "k"), (1, "o")]. Sort problem may produce either valid order of keys and values.
- Upside down T, bot, is the return value if there is no valid output for a given input.
  - ex: Given an input, return its two prime factors. If a number is prime, there are no valid answers.

**Measuring efficiency**

- Given an algorithm A, input x, and a function size(x), runtime is defined as the maximum number of basic operations performed by function A on x.
- Basic operation is arithmetic.
- Non-basic operation is appending to a list or sorting a function.
