**Computational problem**

- A computational problem is often denoted by capital Pi
- Pi is a set of inputs (I), a set of outputs (O), and a set of solutions (f).
- For all x in inputs, f(x) is a subset of outputs
- f(x) is a subset of O because there may be two valid outputs for a given inputs
  - ex: input = [(1, "k"), (1, "o")]. Sort problem may produce either valid order of keys and values.
- Upside down T, bot, is the return value if there is no valid output for a given input.
  - ex: Given an input, return its two prime factors. If a number is prime, there are no valid answers.

**Measuring efficiency**

- Given an algorithm A, input x, and a function size(x), runtime is defined as the maximum number of basic operations performed by function A on x.
- Basic operation is arithmetic.
- Non-basic operation is appending to a list or sorting a function.
- T(n) = max(x \* size(x) <= n)
  - _size(x) <= n_ makes T(n) nondecreasing.
  - Valid on all real inputs.
  - T(n) is the number of basic operations required to perform the computation on input of size at most n.

**Big O notation**

- Let there be two functions, _f_ and _g_
  - _f = O(g)_ if there exists a constant _c > 0_ such that _f(n) <= g(n) \* c_ for all large enough _n_
  - _f = Ω(g)_ if there exists a constant _c > 0_ such that _f(n) > g(n) \* c_ for all large enough _n_
    - _g = O(f)_
  - _f = Θ(g)_ if _f = O(g)_ and _f = Ω(g)_
  - _f = o(g)_ if _lim(n to inf): f(n) / g(n) -> 0_.
  - _f = ω(g)_ if _lim(n to inf): f(n) / g(n) -> ∞_.
- Examples:
  - _O(n)_: the cost is at most _x_
  - _Ω(n)_: the cost is at least _y_
  - _Θ(n)_: the cost is at most _x_ and at least _y_

**Complexity of sorting**

- _T{exhaustive} = Θ(n!(n - 1)) = Θ(n!n)_
- _T{insertion} = Θ(n^2)_
