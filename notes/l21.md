**NP**
- NP usually refers to decision problems, not their search variants
- A problem is in NP if there is a problem in NP-search that the decision can be derived from
  - Is there a solution or not.
- Ex:
  - Is a CNF satisfiable? (decision version of, given a CNF, output a satisfying assignment if one exists)
  - Is there an independent set of size at least k in graph G? (decision version of, given k and G, return an independent set of size at least k if one exists) 
- In NP search, every potential solution should be verifiable
- Finding a solution can be much harder than producing a solution, but they're essentially equivalent in in respect to NP
  - Ex: SAT-search can be reduced to SAT-decision in polynomial time
