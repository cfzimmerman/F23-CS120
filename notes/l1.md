**Search result sorting gotchas**

- Key must be (1 - pagerank) for the most useful results to be first
- Mathematically, must specify that output pairs must be a permutation of input pairs
- Keys might not be unique, so we need to consider what happens when keys are equal

**Exhaustive search sort**

- Find every permutation of the input and check if itâ€™s the solution

**Requirements of an algorithmic proof**

- For every input, algorithm should give a valid output
  1. For every input, there exists a valid output
  2. If there exists a valid output, this algorithm returns something
  3. If algorithm returns something, it returns something valid

**Insertion sort**

- For every member of the input, put it in the correct place in the output array.

**Prove correctness of insertion sort**
Prove by induction on _i_ the claim _P(i)_ = "At the end of step _i_,
_A[0], A[1], ..., A[i]_ is a correct sorting of the first _i + 1_ elements".
_Base case_: _i = 0_. _[A[0]]_ is a valid sort.
_Inductive step_: Insert _A[i + 1] = (k, v)_ into the correct place in
_[A[0], ..., A[i]]_, which are already correctly sorted by induction.
