**NP**

- NP is a class of problems for which verifying is easier than actually solving
  - Ex: easier to determine that a factorization is correct than to produce the factorization
  - All solutions are of polynomial length
  - Solution is verifiable in polynomial time

**NP completeness**

- If an NP search complete problem can be solved efficiently, every NP problem can be solved efficiently
- Cook - Levin Theorem: Sat is NP complete
