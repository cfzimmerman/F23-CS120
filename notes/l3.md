**Computational problem**

- Find a duplicate in a list of elements
- Input: A list of real numbers, a{0} ... a{n - 1}
- Output: A duplicate element. Some real number _a_ such that there there exists _i != j_ such that _a{i} = a{j} = a_
  - If there is no duplicate in the input, we need to suggest no duplicate elements
- Algorithm:
  1. Form an array of _(k_0, v_0)_ with _k_i = a_i, v_i != 1_
  - This is just a formal step to express the input in terms of the input to the sorting problem
  2. Sort
  3. For _0 <= i < n - 1_, check if _s[i].key = s[i + 1].key_
- Runtime: _T{duplicate search} <= O(n) + T{sort}(n)_

**Reductions**

- The point of the algorithm above is to use a subproblem we're familiar with, sorting, as a stepping stone towards a larger problem
- To solve a problem, reduce it to another problem, and solve that.

**Formalism of reduction**

- Look at section 3 lecture notes. There's a full description.
- A reduction is an algorithm that solves the subproblem to solve the parent problem,
- How does an oracle differ from an algorithm? An oracle may be an algorithm. However, some problems may have no algorithm.
  - For example, sorting might be an oracle for an algorithm determining a duplication
- If an algorithm solves Pi using an oracle from Gamma, ...
