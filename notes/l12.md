**Summary from SRE**

- Coloring and independent set problems tend to take a long time
- Greedy solutions try to get a decent solution in less time

**Coloring**

- A graph 2-coloring can be found in time `O(n + m)` by BFS

**Independent sets**

- An independent set is just one color in a graph
- The largest independent set is the color with the most nodes in a minimum coloring
- Greedy independent set algorithm: For every node, consider all edges. If none of the edges connect to a node in the graph, add the node to the independent set
- Theorem: The greedy independent set algorithm finds an independent set of size at least `n / (d_{max} + 1)`
- Takeaway: Greedy coloring and greedy independent set are very similar problems

**Graph coloring to solve interval scheduling**

- If input intervals are sorted by end time, GreedyIntervalScheduling can find an optimal solution to IntervalScheduling-Optimization in time O(n log n)
