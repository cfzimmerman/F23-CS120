**Lemma 3.1**

- Given algorithms Pi and Gamma such that Pi reduces to Gamma:

  - If there exists an algorithm Gamma, tere exists and algorithm solving Pi
  - If there does not exist an algorithm solving Pi, there does not exist an algorithm solving Gamma
  - If an algorithm solves gamma in time g(n) and Pi reduces to Gamma, there exists an algorithm solving Pi with runtime O(T(n) + g(f(n)))
  - And the contrapositive of above

**Church Turing Thesis**

- If a computational problem is solvable in one model of computation, it is solvable in all of them (assuming Word-RAM is included)
- Turing Machine is like Word RAM, but the word length is small and there's no random access with a pointer moving in one dimension
- Lambda Calculus is shown to be as solvable as a Turing Machine

**Extended Church Turing Thesis**

- Every physically realizable model of computation that can be simulated by a Turing Machine or Word RAM can be simulated by a Word RAM program with only polynomial slowdown in runtime
