**Extended Church Turing Thesis**

- Every physically realizable, deterministic, sequential model of computation is simulatable by Word-RAM with at most polynomial slowdown

**Category error**

- A statement like "2 SAT is time O(mn)" doesn't work because "2 SAT" is a computational problem but big O notation describes algorithms.
  - Many algorithms may solve an computational problem with different runtimes

**Problem Independent Size Measurement**

- Measure encoded input size in terms of bits
  - number of inputs times size of eacn input

**Solvability**

- The specific reduction lemma from lecture three can be broadened into an argument about whether or not a problem is solveable in any polynomial time
- For example, a program that takes in a Word RAM program and an input size N, outpt true if and only if the program runs in time less than or equal to 2^n on all inputs of size n.
  - Cannot be solved in polynomial time.
- Can define complexity classes for sets of computational problems distinguished by how long algorithms in the class tend to take
- Ex:
  - Polynomial search is the set of search problems that can be solved in some polynomial time
    - (Often a distinction between search and decision algorithms)
  - Exponential search then contains all problems that can be solved in time at most 2^n^c.
    - Any problem in P search is also in Ex search
