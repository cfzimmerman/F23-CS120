**Greedy interval scheduling**

- Sort by end time, choose the first non-conflicting end time in each interval

**Maximum matching problem**

- Input: A graph
- Output: A matching M in Edges from the graph of maximum size

**Maximum matching algorithm**

- Definitions (in lecture notes):
  - Alternating walk
  - Augmenting path
    - The first and last vertices are distinct
    - The first and last vertices are unmatched
    - We never visit the same node twice
