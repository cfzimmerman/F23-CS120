**AVL Tree Rotations**

- Difference in height between any adjacent nodes must be 1
- AVL violations can be fixed by at-most two rotations
- A rotation must properly transfer children (draw a picture)

**RAM model**

- A program consists of a sequence of commands and a set of variables
- The set of commands is finite and a natural number
- A command can be one of five:
  - Set the value of a variable to some constant
  - Arithmetic assignment from _+, -, โข, รท_
  - Read a value from memory
  - Write a value from memory
  - Conditional goto a constant line number

**Computation within a RAM program**

- Initialization: encode inputs into memory
- Execution: run commands in order, transforming state as needed
- Output: if the program reaches the final line, output is defined as a pointer to a memory location
  - If the program fails to halt, define its return value to be _bot_
- Time for a program is the number of commands executed
