**One sided problems**

- A program solves a one sided decision problem if:
  - For every input where `f(input) = yes`, then P(w) halts and returns yes
  - For every input where `f(input) = no`, then if P(w) halts then it returns no
  - Implies that P is allowed to not halt, but if it does halt then it must be correct
