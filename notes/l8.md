**Using randomness in algorithms**

- Augment _RAM_ to have a random number generator

**Las Vegas Algorithms**

- Always outputs a correct answer, but runtime depends on random choices.
  - For very unfortunate random choices, computation might take a really long time.
  - Las Vegas algorithms can run forever, so we try to bound their expected (worst case) running time

**Example**

- Input: n is a compositve number
- Output: some divisor of n
- Possible algorithm:
  - choose a random number k < sqrt(n)
  - if k | n, output k else repeat

**Monte Carlo Algorithms**

- Runs within a time bound T(n), but errors are allowed
- Let p be the error tolerance
- See notes for full definition.
  - Gives chances of a correct solution in terms of probablility 1 - p
  - And changes of incorrect solution in terms of probability 1 - p

**Comparison**

- Las Vegas algorithms are often preferable.
  - Every Las Vegas algorithm can be converted into a Monte Carlo algorithm with comparable runtime
  - Not every Monte Carlo algorithm can be converted into a Las Vegas algorithm (or such a claim is unknown)
- Monte carlo algorithms are often easier to come up with

**Quickselect**

- Las Vegas example has average _O(n)_
- See implementation in `quick_select.py`
