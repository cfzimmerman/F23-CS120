**SRE**

- BFS counting how many connecting components in a graph takes `O(m + n)` time

**Shortest path**

- Have each new node store a pointer to its parent
- From node to start, begin at node and follow the parent pointer backward

**Graph Coloring**

- Motivation problem: What's the minimum number of registers we need to run a computation
- Live region: for a variable, the set of lines for which we need to know the value of the variable
- In: A graph with keys in the natural numbers
- Out: A proper k-coloring of G where a proper k coloring allows no two nodes of the same color to touch
- Similar to the challenge to find a partition of vertices into few disjoint sets such that all edges are between sets
- Greedy algorithm for graph coloring does not produce a minimum coloring
- BFS version of greedy algorithm does better

**Theorem**

- If a graph can be colored with two colors, then BFS greedy coloring succeeds at finding it
