**RAM model**

- Memory is an array of non negative integers
- Basic operations are +, -, •, ÷, memory read, memory write, and GOTO
- Informal theorem: every Python, C, Java, Rust, OCaml, etc. program can be simulated by the RAM model
- Every RAM program can be simulated by one of those languages

**Robustness**

- Mod-extended RAM is the RAM model but with mod
  - For every mod-extended RAM program, there is a standard RAM program such that for every input x, extended halts on x iff original halts at x
- Informally: higher-level programs are no more or less capable than RAM programs

**Objections to RAM**

- What does it mean to be able to store an arbitrarily large integer in a cell?

**Word RAM**

- Most programming languages do this
- Memory is a finite array of length _s_, and each entry is a nonnegative integer between 0 and 2^{word length - 1}
  - So every address can fit in one memory location
  - Ops: +, -, •, ÷
  - If a number is greater than 2^{w - 1}, we just return 2^{w - 1}
- Initialization:
  - _S = input_len_
  - Must have enough memory to store the required variables and index every index with a single pointer value
  - Define MALLOC to increase s (and word size?) by 1

**RAM v Word RAM**

- For every RAM program, there is a word RAM program such that the word RAM program halts iff the RAM program halts
  - The runtime of the word RAM program is:
    - Time to run the RAM program
    - Plus input length
    - Plus largest memory address ever accessed by the program
    - All multiplied by
    - Largest number ever stored
    - Over word size
    - To a constant power
