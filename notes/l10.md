**Graphs**

- Directed graph: G = (V, E) is a finite set of vertices and a set E of urdered pairs (u, v) where u, v in V and u â‰  v
- By default, assume a graph is a simple, unweighted, undirected graph, and a digraph means a simple, unweighted, directed

**Shortest path problem**

- Input: a digraph G = (V, E) and two vertices, s, t = V
- Output: a shortest walk from s to t in G if any such walk exists
  - Path is a walk in which vertices don't repeat
- Lemma: If w is the shortest walk from s to t, then w is a path
  - Distance between two vertices is at most n - 1 if not infinity

**Exhaustive solution**

- Enumerate all paths from s in increasing length
  - Stop if the path is ever found or once we reach the end of the list of paths
- Runtime is about O(n^n)

**BFS solution (simple)**

- Collect neighbors of the vertex by how many steps from the start they are

**BFS solution (better)**

- Use a queue
