# CS 120: Algorithms and their Limitations

I took this course in the fall of 2023. The content covered algorithms, data structures, reductions, CS proofs, and an introduction to major topics in theoretical CS.

Each pset directory contains my work as a Latex PDF and, for some problem sets, Python code.
